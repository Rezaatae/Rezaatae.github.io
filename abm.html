            <h1>Agent Based Modelling in Migratory
                Behaviour in Response to Policy.</h1>
            
                <h3>Abstract</h3>
                <p>Gaining a better understanding of emerging patterns in society can aid policymakers formulate policies capable of better guidance of decision-making, resulting in more rational outcomes. Human migration flow is an example of an emergent phenomenon in societies resulting from the decision-making of individuals. Research in human migration flow, in its early years, was largely dominated by simplistic models that hindered the understanding of this complex branch of knowledge to its full extent. However, with the development of more sophisticated computer simulations, research in migration flow has welcomed a new wave of potential discoveries in recent decades, with more dynamic approaches by different domains from computer science to psychology.</p>
                
                <p>Research in migration flow is still growing, and this thesis attempts to fill the gap between the quantitative analysis of different drivers of human migration and their implementation in agent-based models (ABMs). In doing so, this thesis extracts an optimal set of features that have the largest influence on migration decision-making for first-time migrants, including Fathers’ migration status, extended family members ever in U.S., Sex, Mothers’ migration status, current land holdings, past land holdings, marital status, and age. These features are implemented in a simple empirical ABM simulation that can predict migration decisions with 0.896 accuracy compared to theoretical results produced by a classification algorithm.</p>

                <h3>Data</h3>
                <p>Data analysed in this study are sourced from the Mexican Migration Project
                    (MMP). The MMP is a collaborative research project based at Prince
                    ton University and the University of Guadalajara. According to the MMP
                    website, the MMP data must only be used for research and/or educational
                    purposes, the data must not be used to identify any individual, household
                    or migrant community, and the accessed data must not be shared to anyone
                    who does not agree to respect these confidentiality terms. Their most up to
                    date database, MMP174, spans from the period of 1987 to 2019. The dataset
                    includes 27,706 Mexican households and 1,075 U.S. households containing, in
                    total, 179,321 individuals.</p>
                    
                <p>The main advantage of using data from the MMP
                    as opposed to other data sources such as OECD is that the features intended
                    for analysis in this study were all readily available in one place in the MMP
                    database. A disadvantage, however, is that the data source used here is lim
                    ited to one geographical region, that is Mexico. Therefore, an advantage of
                    using another data source, say OECD, would have been the ability to access
                    data from various regions which could make the results of this study more
                    generalisable to different migration scenarios.</p>
                <h3>Data Analysis</h3>
                <p>The “HOUSE” dataset from MMP174 database is explored in this data anal
                    ysis. This dataset contains 28,781 observations and 548 variables. The vari
                    ables in this dataset contain information about household composition, mari
                    tal information, social networks, and physical capital. From the 548 variables
                     only 32 are considered in our data analysis which are related to the head of
                     households. The 32 variables include age and sex as well as marital history,
                     income, number of sons, number of daughters, father and mothers’ migra
                    tion history, number of extended family members ever migrated to U.S., land
                     holdings owned currently and previously, property holdings, business hold
                    ings, and number of U.S. trips, see table 4.1. These specific variables are
                     chosen because they correspond to the factors identified in Klabunde 2014
                     and are important features that affect migratory behaviour. However, it
                     is important to note that not all features essential to migratory behaviour,
                     as identified by Klabunde 2014, are considered. The features that are
                     related to return migration such as green card status, documentation used
                     for trip, and last U.S. wage, are not included since the scope of this study
                     does not include return migration. The features identified in this section (see
                     table 4.1) are processed in the data pre-processing section and analysed using
                     machine learning algorithms in the feature selection and feature importance
                     sections. It is ideal to use machine learning algorithms for our data analysis
                     because we have plenty of observations in our dataset, therefore, the machine
                     learning algorithms can be optimally trained and produce meaningful results.
                     Also, this process is faster than manually calculating different metrics for all
                     the features.</p>
                     <h3>Data Pre-processing</h3>
                     <p>Before analysing the data, it is important to process the 8888 and 9999
                        values within the dataset because these are coded values. Table 4.1 shows
                        that all 8888 values represent “no observations”. Therefore, 8888 values can
                        also be represented by zeros. An exception to this, however, is the variable
                        representing number of U.S. trips. In this variable, 8888 values represent
                        individuals born in the U.S., and since this study is analysing Mexico to
                        U.S. migration, 8888 observations in the number of U.S. trips are removed
                        from the dataset. 9999 values represent unknown values. This means that
                        observations encoded by 9999 may exist, but they are not known. One option
                        of processing these values would be to remove them from the dataset entirely,
                        but 9999 values make up for at least 74% of the observations in the dataset
                        from the Income variable alone (see table 4.2) and since further analysis
                        of the data will require training machine learning algorithms using the data,
                        removing them can result in an under-fitted model and therefore produce
                        inaccurate results. Hence, 9999 values will be replaced by the most frequent
                        values observed from the existing observations of the dataset. Note that
                        these 9999 values will be processed separately for each of the data analysis
                        processes, that is feature selection and feature importance. This is due to
                        the fact that the feature selection process will require splitting the data into
                        training and testing sets, and if 9999 values are not treated carefully, data
                        leakage will occur and create inaccurate results.</p>

                    <p>
                        Further data modification is performed to generalize the data. From table
 4.1 we can see that the variables representing physical capital of individuals
 such as lands, properties, and businesses are observed in 4 instances, and
 each instance is coded by the category of the variable. To get a more gen
eralized measure of the effects of physical capital on migratory behaviour,
 the four instances for each of these variables are combined regardless of their
 category to give a measure of the total lands, properties, and businesses owned by each individual, ranging from 1 to 4. A disadvantage of this pro
 cess is information loss. For example, ignoring the types of lands prevents
  measuring the effects of different types of land owned on migration. How
 ever, for further study, one could use dummy variables to include all types
  of lands, properties, and businesses owned to further measure their effects
  on migration patterns. We perform this process on several variables; sons
  and daughters are combined to give number of children; number of uncles,
  cousins, nieces, siblings, children in law, and parents in law ever in the U.S.
  are combined as number of extended family members ever in the U.S. Next,
  to understand the effect of parents’ migration status on migration patterns,
  the mother and fathers’ migration history which is represented by their first
  migration date in the dataset are modified by converting any non-zero obser
 vations to 1. This classifies each individuals’ mother and father as migrants
  or non-migrants. Similarly, the Union type variable is modified to 0 or 1
  classifications generalising individuals’ marital status in the dataset. After
  modifying the data, 14 features are extracted from the raw dataset (see 4.3).
  These features are used in the feature selection section to extract an optimal
  set of features based on their influence on the migration status classification
  of individuals.
                     </p>
                     <h3>Feature Selection</h3>
                     <p>Asequential feature selector is used with a classification algorithm to
                        categorically identify the optimal number of features in the modified dataset.
                        Using a sequential feature selector is ideal as it allows rapid analysis of differ
                       ent combinations of variables in the dataset to find the set with the optimal
                        performance. This process measures and compares the ability of the classifier
                        to predict individuals’ migration status using different combinations of fea
                       tures from the dataset, resulting in the combination with the best predictions
                        as the optimal set of features. Three classifiers are considered for this pro
                       cedure: Logistic Regression, Naïve Bayes, and K-Nearest Neighbours (knn).
                        These classifiers are discretely trained on 75% of the dataset and tested on
                        the remaining 25% before comparing each classifier based on their accuracy.
                        Accuracy is the measure of the classifiers’ ability to predict true positive and
                        true negative classifications. This is an ideal metric for this study as the
                        cost of false positives and false negatives are relatively low. The matrix of
                        features used to train and test the classification algorithms are all the fea
                       tures shown in table 4.3, except for Total number of U.S. trips. Assuming
                       the number of U.S. trips can be generalised as the classification of individ
                       uals’ migration status, regardless of the exact number of trips, the number
                        of U.S. trips variable is used to derive the dependant variable in this part
                        of the data analysis by converting any observations with non-zero number
                        of migrations to 1, classifying individuals as migrants (1) or non-migrants
                        (0). Before performing feature selection, an optimal number of neighbours
                        in the knn algorithm must be determined. This is done by measuring and
                        plotting the accuracy of the classifier with a range of neighbours from 1 to
                        50 (see figure 4.1). In the graph shown in figure 4.1 we can see that the knn
                        algorithm performs best with 16 neighbours with a maximum accuracy of
                        0.702.</p>
                     <p>Figure 4.2 shows the results from the feature selection process. In this fig
                        ure in can be seen that the Logistic Regression classifier successfully identified
                         8 features (Fathers’ migration status, Mothers’ migration status, Extended
                         family members ever in U.S., Sex, Marital status, Age, Total current land
                         holdings, and Total past land holdings) with the highest accuracy of 0.735,
                         outperforming Naïve Bayes and knn classifiers. Table 4.4 shows the exact
                         combinations of features from 1 to 13 features(s) and their corresponding
                         accuracies identified by the sequential feature selector using the Logistic Re
                        gression classifier.</p>
                     <h3>Feature Importance</h3>
                     <p>Assuming the correlation between a feature and the number of U.S. trips
                        can represent the importance of that feature in an individuals’ decision to
                        migrate, a Linear Regression algorithm is used to measure the relative im
                       portance of the optimal set of features. In this process, the Linear Regression
                        algorithm is trained on the dataset using the optimal set of 8 features as the
                        independent variables, and the total number of U.S. trips as the dependant
                        variable. This algorithm describes the relations between the features and the
                        number of migrations by individuals according to the linear equation shown
                        below.</p>
                     <p>y =c0 +c1x1 +c2x2 +c3x3 +c4x4 +c5x5 +c6x6 +c7x7</p>

                     <img src="./assets/abmf4-2.png" alt="alt">
                     <p>Subsequently, a set of predicted values are produced by feeding the inde
                        pendent variables into the regression model once more. Next, multiplying
                         the respective coefficients, cn, of each variable, calculated by the regression
                         model, by the standard deviation of each variable in the dataset, the relative
                         importance of the variables is calculated. Table 4.5 shows these values for
                         each feature. Visualising the normalized importance values in figure 4.3, Fa
                        thers’ migration status shows the highers importance with 100% importance
                         followed by Sex showing about 40% importance. Exact values shown in table
                         4.5.</p>

                    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
                    <p>This study has explored a set of influential features in human migration to
                        find the most important features affecting the decision to migrate. This pro
                       cess took place in two steps; firstly, using a sequential feature selector applied
                        to data extracted from the MMP174 database to identify the optimal set of
                        features in the data. Secondly, conducting a linear regression analysis to find
                        the relative importance of each feature in the optimal set to find the exact
                        measure of importance each feature has in deciding to migrate. Results from
                        the first step showed 8 features (see table 4.4), that is Fathers’ migration
                        status, Sex, Extended family members ever in U.S., Mothers’ migration status, 
                        Age, Current land holdings, Marital status, Past land holdings to be
                        the optimal set of features with a maximum classification model accuracy of
                        0.735 produced by the Logistic Regression classifier used in the sequential
                        feature selector. A limitation affecting this result is the fact that the Income
                        and the Last domestic wage variables contained a considerable number of
                        missing values, 21403 and 16657 missing values, respectively. These income
                        variables are strong indicators of individuals’ capability of migration which
                        ties in heavily in the decision to migrate . This can also be seen
                        from the importance indicated by the Total past and current land holdings
                        attributes, in the feature importance analysis, that did not contain as many
                        missing values (see table 4.2), as these features are also strong indicators
                        of an individuals’ economic capital. Furthermore, network effects have also
                        shown a very strong influence in the decision to migrate through father and mothers’ migration status as well as extended family members ever in the
                        U.S. This is promising since network effects have been identified as influential
                        to migratory behaviour by many studies, due to
                        the strong correlation between networks and migratory behaviour, since net
                       works can make the migration process easier for new migrants by providing
                        initial support, according to Klabunde et al. 2016. For future work,
                        more accurate data related to income variables of individuals would help to
                        get a better understanding of how income affects the decision to migrate. An
                        assumption made in the data analysis is that the number of U.S. trips can be
                        generalised as the classification of individuals’ migration status, regardless
                        of the exact number of trips. This assumption overlooks the fact that some
                        of the features may have had different values at the time of individuals’ first
                        migration. This generalisation reduces the precision of the results found in
                        the data analysis, therefore, for future work more precise data would help to
                        improve the results in this study.</p>
                        <p>Applying a linear regression model to the optimal set of features and the
                            level of migration show that Fathers’ migration status and Sex normalized
                            importance values of 100 and 41, respectively, have the highest impact on
                            levels of migration between the optimal set of features identified in this study
                            (see figure 4.3). These findings are promising as they highlight the impact of
                            networks, idiosyncratic home bias, and gender of individuals on the migra
                           tion decision, in agreement with other studies. An assumption
                            made in this process is that the correlation between features and the level
                            of migration can be translated into the importance of that feature on the
                            decision of an individual to migrate. This generalisation is a source of uncer
                           tainty in the data analysis. A way of mitigating this source of uncertainty
                            would be to carry out a survey asking individuals what their perceived level
                            of importance is on each of the variables on their decision to migrate.</p>
