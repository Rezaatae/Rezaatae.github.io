            <h1>Reza Ataeigharacheh</h1>
            <p>Software Developer specialised in Python and SQL and a Data Science enthusiast.</p>
            
            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Curious and analytically minded with an affinity for data and mathematics. Enjoys learning and sharing new ideas and solving problems.</p>

            <p>I am currently working as a software developer applying Python, SQL and problem solving skills to design and develop innovative solutions for software 
                products used by police forces and private sector across the UK. In addition to my technical expertise, I thrive in collaborative environments and take pride in my ability to quickly adapt and learn new technologies. 
                Participating in a hackathon during my time at Aston University, I gained hands-on experience with time management and self-learning under pressure. I've also 
                gained plenty of work experience in an Agile team setting as a Software Developer in my current role.</p>
            
            <p>With a BSc in Physics and Astronomy, working with data and mathematics is something that I'm passionate about. Utilizing my mathematics background 
                to analyse and draw insights from data during my MSc Computer Science <a href="./portfolio">projects</a> was an experience I thoroughly enjoyed, therefore, exploring Data Science applications in the real world is of great interest to me.</p>
